Some instructions for 3rd-party features using in the AlphaControls full release :

1. Most standard and 3rd-party controls

Skinned automatically if required controls are declared in the SkinManager.ThirdParty property and SkinManager.SkinningRules.srThirdParty property is true

2. TntControls Unicode

Most controls from AlphaControls package may have support of Unicode (in Delphi6-2009). In this case used the TntControls package (thanks TNT authors, TntControls must be installed already). For using this feature should be uncommented the TNTUNICODE key in the sDefs.inc file (should be {$DEFINE TNTUNICODE}) and AlphaControls package must be reinstalled (sources needed). 
Note : don't forget backup all projects before opening after package installation, some Unicode data may be lost if compiled without TNTUNICODE key.

3. TPngImageList

Since version 6 AlphaControls have native support of PNG format (TsAlphaImageList was added also).
Buttons and menus from AlphaControls have support of TPngImageList component also. For work with this component the USEPNG key should be defined in the sDefs.inc file (must be {$DEFINE USEPNG}).
TPNGImageList is a freeware component with sources that may be used for work with PNG glyphs in any application.
May be downloaded from http://www.thany.org/article/32/PngComponents

4. DevExpress grids and other controls

 - Install DevExpress and AlphaControls
 - Enable the 'DEVEX6'(if old DevEx version used) or 'DEVEX2011' key in the sDefs.inc file (AlphaControls), must be {$DEFINE DEVEX6} or {$DEFINE DEVEX2011}
 - Be sure that latest version of DevExpress is installed if 'DEVEX2011' key used, or check a list of supported DevExpress versions in the beginning of the acLFPainter.pas file (AlphaControls)
 - Configure the sSkinManager component and compile the project.
In the run-time will be skinned all DevExpress controls which have LookAndFeel property properly supported. LookAndFeel.NativeStyle property must be False. 'DEVEX' key must be enabled (in the sDefs.inc file) before AlphaControls installing (must be {$DEFINE DEVEX}).
Do not add DevExpress control into SkinManager ThirdParty list.

5. Billenium Effects

This package is supported authomatically

6. TWebBrowser

The ADDWEBBROWSER key should be enabled in the sDefs.inc file before a package installing. Sources of the package are required.
TWebBrowser type should be added in sSkinManager1.ThirdParty list as 'WebBrowser'
